## _Install Flyctl and Login_

We are ready to start working with Fly and that means we need `flyctl`, our CLI app for managing apps on Fly. If you've already installed it, carry on. If not, hop over to [our installation guide](/docs/getting-started/installing-flyctl/). Once thats installed you'll want to [log in to Fly](/docs/getting-started/log-in-to-fly/).
