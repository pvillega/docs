You can deploy your [NuxtJS](https://nuxtjs.org) app on Fly with minimal effort, our CLI will do the heavy lifting. You can use your existing NuxtJS app or you can [create one using the tutorial](https://nuxtjs.org/docs/get-started/installation#using-create-nuxt-app) then come back here to deploy your app.

## _Generate the NuxtJS app_

If you just want to see how Fly deployment works, follow these steps.

Now let's launch your NuxtJS app.

<%= partial "partials/launch", locals: { detected: "NuxtJS", app_name: app_name } %>

<%= partial "partials/launched" %>
